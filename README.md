<h3 align="center">Phase 3 Project:</h3>
<h1 align="center">Lets Get Quizzical: A Quiz App</h1>
<h4 align="center">A simple trivia app spanning multiple categories</h4>

## Description

My goal was to make a quiz app where you can play multiple quizzes from one main menu screen. Each quiz will have a simple question on the front and then to find the answer you hit a key to "flip" the card to the other side.

## Languages and Dependencies

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**
  * **[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)**


## Future

In the future , I would like to create multiple choice options for the various quizzes. In addition, I hope to create many more quizzes and implement a random functionality in the test questions.
